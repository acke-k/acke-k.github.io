  <h1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website.</h1>
    <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>

  <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
    <p><strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong></p>
    <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that
      <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a>
      into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it
      <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
    <li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
    <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
    <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that
      visits your site</li>
    <li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
    <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site.
      Here's how.</p>

  <h2>Let it breathe</h2>
    <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building.
      Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping.
      The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code>
      for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If
      you can't see that...piss off.</p>
  <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever.
    You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>

  <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life ?
      Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background
      a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping
      declarations to a lean 7 fucking
      lines.</p><h2>Size Matters</h2>
    <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy
      to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not
      the screen.</p><h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
    <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a
      line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice
      60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your
      worthless dribble.</p><h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire,
      you fuck</h3>
    <p>I love what the creator of
    <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a>
      did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier
      to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional,
      high-performing, and accessible, but
      they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there
      need to make them not total shit.</p>
